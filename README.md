# Text-Classification

This repo is used to  implement text classification on datasets

I have listed all the classification models and you can try with your custoom input and run the model.

The Classifier i have used are:
1.Logistic Regression                      -90.05060
2.Decision tree                                -92.4455
3.Random forest classifier            -92.0158
4.Naive bayes(GaussianNB)          -85.318
5. Naive bayes(MultinominalNB)-90.066
6. Naive bayes(BernouliNB)          -90.4506
7.Support vector machines[svm]-92.4455
8.K-nearest neighbours                 -92.4334
